Hi Web developer enthusiast, I had successfully created a web application project using Html, CSS and Java script front end languages.This project is a sportify inspired web application for playing music with additional functionality for user login or account creation. So today i am gonna break the project's concept and explain its main features.

1.User Authentication:

--> In login.html page, it allows user to Create/Login an sportify clone account.
--> It includes fields for a Username and Password, which are submitted via in form.

2.Music Library Interface:

--> In index.html page, it serves as the main interface which displays list of songs in visually 
    appealing format
--> In this page it includes a navigation bar with home, about and a login form link page.
--> User can also interact  with the page by playing songs from the library and the current selected 
    playing song will be displayed at the bottom of the main page.

3. Music Player:
   
--> Using script.js I added buttons and user can interact play, pause and next buttons.
--> The player includes a progress bar to track the current timestamp position and  adjust playback.

4. Responsive Design:

--> The style.css makes use of media queries to adjust the page layout and background color based 
    on the screen size.
--> This site uses Google's fonts for a modern, clean look.

5. Interactivity:

-->The script.js is responsible for handling music playback functionality like song selection, 
   play/pause behaviour and  display the current song at bottom of the page.
--> I added some special elements  like animated GIF(playing.gif) shows when playing a song, 
    logo(logo.png) background image(bg.jpg) added to website from external sources. 
  
6. Conclusion:

   At last after creating project, i gained hands on experience about creating a web application.
